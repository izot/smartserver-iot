Some organizations, like the General Services Administration (GSA), require a warning banner with specific, approved language at IT access points to the SmartServer IoT. 

Go to: https://edgedocs.enocean.com/ and search for: `Adding an Access Warning Banner` The files in this folder (`home.png`, and `warningLogo.svg` for SmartServer IoT versions prior to 4.2) and (`bg-login.jpg`, and `cms-login-background.jpg` for SmartServer IoT versions after 4.2 ) are referenced in the documentation portal instructions on how to integrate these files.
