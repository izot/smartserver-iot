Device Type Package Files and BACnet Type Mapping Files for EnOcean Self-Powered Sensors.  There are directories for each supported region.

NOTE: These .dtp files will not work with IoTC or SmartStudio remote connections, the associated .dtd file(s) will need to be modified to use "iotc" and 
not "enocean" in the "Protocol" field.
