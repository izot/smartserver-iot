# astroClock.js
This application provides time, sunrise, sunset, dusk, and dawn times to share with edge devices in outdoor lighting systems.  It applies to a class of devices that require knowledge of local time, and the local dusk and dawn times to schedule load control.  
## Release Notes
1.00.002 - Initial application release.  08/25/2021
1.00.005 - Deployment package and setup script updated to support setup on systems that may have a newer ApolloDev resources.
1.00.006 - Now using suncalc.js for astroevent calculations (same as the SmartServer scheduler).  Added astroEvent.js tool for cmd line testing.
1.00.008 - Updated resource files 1.41 and created new setup script to support the 4.0 service environment. (setup4_0.sh)

## UFPTastroClock
This UFPT provides data points intended to align with Lon devices that understand SNVT_time_stamp, and SNVT_switch for direct control.  This functional block provides the functionality of the UCPTrealtimeClock found in SmartServer 2. The resources defining this interface are part of ApolloDev.typ 1.31 or higher.

| Network Variable | Type | Notes |
|--- | --- | ---|
|nvoAfterDark|SNVT_switch|Set to {value:100,State:0} between civil dusk and civil dawn|
|nvoDawn|SNVT_time_stamp|Time for today's civil dawn|
|nvoDusk|SNVT_time_stamp|Time for today's civil dusk|
|nvoSunrise|SNVT_time_stamp|Time for today's sunrise|
|nvoSunset|SNVT_time_stamp|Time for today's sunset|
|nvoLocalTime|SNVT_time_stamp|Current local time|

This application uses the lat/lng coordinates of the segment controller.  You can determine the configure GPS location using the Device widget in the CMS, and reposition as necessary. 

These configuration properties are used to manage operation of this functional profile.
| CP | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | ---|
|cpPowerLine|UCPTpowerLine|Default: 1, means the controller will throttle nvo traffic for Powerline.  Updates use a 30s throttle.|
|cpDawnAdjust|UCPToffsetSunrise|Default:0, +-30m adjustment to civil dawn time to adjust for local conditions.  Does not affect sunrise time.|
|cpDuskAdjust|UCPToffsetSunset|Default:0, +-30m adjustment to civil dusk time to adjust for local conditions.|
|cpTimeHb|SCPTmaxSendTime|Default: 300s, Time between updates to nvoLocalTime|
|cpDuskDawnHb|UCPTmaxSendTime|Default: 300s, Time between updates to daytime switching times.  The nvoAfterDark also follows this rate.|

Power line requires special consideration to control updates to the channel.  In systems requiring more than 3 hops, it is best practice to limit updates to every 300s.  This application will prevent offering channel updates for a configured throttle time when cpPowerLine is set to 1.  If you are not connecting the outputs of the UFPTastroClock to any devices on the power line, set to 0 to get un-throttled updates. The instructions below are for SmartServer firmware 4.0 and higher.  The setup4_0.sh script is designed to support both pre-4.0 and 4.xx service environments.  The original setup.sh is included for completeness.

## Deployment Instructions
1. Power up the SmartServer, and confirm the CMS has fully started up.
2. Copy files is the folder `astroClockDeploy` to as USB flash drive.
3. Insert the drive in an empty USB port on your SmartServer.  
4. Type: `cd /media/usb0/astroClockDeploy`
5. Type: `sudo ./setup4_0.sh`
Here is an example of the setup.sh output for successful installation. 
```
apollo@smartserver-17q5t6a:/media/usb0/astroClock$ sudo ./setup.sh ea1
AstroClock device installer
Using apollo password: ea1
Creating install directory /var/apollo/data/astroClock
Extracting files from archive
Archive:  ./astroClock.zip
  inflating: astroClock.conf
  inflating: astroClock.dtp
  inflating: astroClock.js

Resetting file ownership to apollo
Moving astroClock package to /var/apollo/data/dtp-files.d
Loading astroClock package to the CMS as user/pwd apollo/ea1
CMS is ready.
Upload of dtp files complete.
Creating astro-1 lon.attach:local device
apollo@smartserver-17q5t6a:/media/usb0/astroClock$ pwd
/media/usb0/astroClock
apollo@smartserver-17q5t6a:/media/usb0/astroClock$
```

5. If you login to the SmartServer CMS, you will see the astro-1 device in the CMS Device widget.

5. Reboot your SmartServer.  
6. Allow 3 minutes and verify operation of the astroClock application by connecting by SSH and typing: `tail -f /var/log/supervisor/astroClock.log` You should expect output similar to this:
```
root@smartserver-17qanut:~# tail -f /var/log/supervisor/astroClock.log
astroClock.js - version: 1.00.002
Sunrise: 6:23:25 AM, Sunset: 7:29:06 PM
Dawn: 5:57:31 AM, Dusk: 7:54:56 PM
Allowing SIOT processes to initialize.  Sleep for: 180s
SmartServer SID: 17qanut

8/25/2021, 2:30:22 PM - delayToSchedule: 45877443ms.
```
## Notes on Operation
The cpPowerline property defaults to 1.  When set to 1 a pacing delay is used when updating nvo points to avoid congestion on the power line channel.  The default is 20s, but the first command line parameter can override the pacing delay.  The installed `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/astroClock.conf`, is set to 30, which is generally a reasonable conservative value in a PL repeating environment.  

The `nvoAfterDark` point (`SNVT_switch`) will fire at the calculated nvoDawn and nvoDusk times with relative to cpDawnAdjust and cpDuskAdjust offsets applied.  

The dawn and dusk positions are defined as 6 degrees below the horizon which is defines civil dusk and civil dawn.  This is the generally accepted point to define the operation of outdoor lighting in most cases.

The installation script creates the internal device `astro-1`.  If you delete the device in the CMS, you need to either re-run the setup script, or use the application `localDev.exe` (https://github.com/izot/smartserver-iot/tree/master/apps/localDev) to create it again.  It is critical to use the handle `astro-1` when creating the internal device to implement this feature.  Here is what the command line needs to be:
 `localDev 90000106000A8511 astro-1 [SmartServer IP address]`

 If you re-image your SmartServer, you need to re-deploy the astroClockPackage.zip using setup.sh.  An apollo-reset normal, or configuration UI Reset Databases operation will require re-deployment of the astroClockPackage, or recreation of the astro-1 device using the `localDev.exe` application.

 Position changes of the SmartServer IoT Edge Server in the will force the recalculation of the solar events.

 The datapoint `nvoLocalTime` by default is send every 300s which is the value of `cpTimeHb`. If this is not connected to devices on a power line network it is safe to set this value to 10 so you have a fresh few of the SmartServer local time viewable from the datapoint browser widget.

##astroEvents.js
This application is used to:
1. Determine civil dusk/dawn times for today: `node astroEvent.js`
2. Determine civil dusk/dawn times for any date: `node astroEvent.js yyyy mm dd`
3. Set the SmartServer lat/lng and timezone: `sudo node astroEvent.js yyyy mm dd lat lng timezone` note that longitudes east of 0 are negative, as are latitudes south of the equator.  The timezone string must exactly match one of the timezones reported when you execute this command: `timedatectl list-timezones`
